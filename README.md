## Code Quality Reports

We use [dslinter](https://github.com/SERG-Delft/dslinter) to detect code smells specific to Machine Learning.
The linter is configured using the [.pylintrc configuration file provided by dslinter](https://github.com/Hynn01/dslinter/blob/main/docs/pylint-configuration-examples/pylintrc-with-only-dslinter-settings/.pylintrc).

You can run the linter as follows:
```bash
pylint <path_to_sources>
```

This will create a code quality report in the `reports` folder
